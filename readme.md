## Deprecated

Mind that this is no longer being developed since Combodo now has its own Webhook integration available.

* [GitHub: Combodo/combodo-webhook-integration](https://github.com/Combodo/combodo-webhook-integration)
* [iTop Hub: Webhook integration](https://store.itophub.io/en_US/products/combodo-webhook-integration)


## What?

Adds a REST action, to which you can link a trigger.
A conceptual extension. Get in touch to discuss integrations with other software, preferably using an API.


## Cookbook

PHP
* how to implement a custom Notification that can be triggered (= the action to be executed)
* how to implement a custom EventNotification

## Short write-up

**Triggers** are activated with **context** information.  
This context information is then passed to **actions**.
Usually an **event** is logged when an **action** is triggered.

This is mainly a concept of a webhook, without much polishment.

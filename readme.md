## Cookbook

PHP
* how to implement a custom Notification that can be triggered (= the action to be executed)
* how to implement a custom EventNotification

## Short write-up

**Triggers** are activated with **context** information.  
This context information is then passed to **actions**.
Usually an **event** is logged when an **action** is triggered.

This is mainly a concept of a webhook, without much polishment.
